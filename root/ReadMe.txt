G'Day!!

I'm happy to announce the Lord of the Rings - LCG plugin for LackeyCCG!! I would like to thank Bootylctin who wrote the original LoTR_LCG Plugin withthe core set as well as Trevor the creator of LackeyCCG whom with out there would of course BE no LackeyCCG. So a big thanks to you guys!!

Though of course the true thanks must go to FFG and the talented designers there how make the game itself.

Please SUB and Comment.. I love that shit!


--== Information on Updates ==--
I am a avid collector of a variety of Card Games and in NO WAY condone piracy. These games are extremely cool but the niche group of players makes it sometimes hard for legit players like myself to play with our cards in real life. This plugin is designed for people that already own the card game itself and their international friends form the FFG website community to play together.

If you like this game please support FFG and buy it. LackeyCCG is cool, but there is no real substitute for playing it in real life with cards in your hands.

To that end FFG requests the LackeyCCG plugin to be kept 6 MONTHS BEHIND the official release dates of the real cards. I of course will be adhering to this rule.

Please DO NOT ask me for cards early, I will not give them to you.

--== More Infomation ==--
I'm pretty busy now and find updating this plugin takes a lot of time alone with my other LackeyCCG plusing. I will keep updating it but it will not be in sync with a regular release schedual. Sorry but that is the way it is.

If anyone wants to take over the plugin officially, then please let me know. I am happy tro pass it on for somone more active if they wish.

Thanks again!
Have Fun and ROLL HIGH

** Changes **
*************
Fixed - Travel Announcment Voice now says the correct phase
Fixed - Now each general token is 100% unique. (Changed 2nd green token to pink)
Changed - Removed "Hover" Button. I do not think anyone uses it.

Changed - All buttons have been abreviated to Initials to save screen space for iPad 

versions. This may make the WIN/MAC/Linux version a little harder to use. Remeber there 

is keybindsings. If people want the "full buttons" back.. I'll make a new download URL 

for ipad and one for PC that has the full buttons.

Top Button Bar

RA = Refersh All / Threat +1 / Draw 1 Card (F1)
D = Draw 1 Card (F2)
DE = Draw Encounter (F5)
DS = Draw Shadow (F6)
DQ = Draw Quest (F4)
DE2 = Draw from 2nd Encounter Deck (F7)
DS2 = Draw Shadow from 2nd Encounter Deck (F8)
TC = Take control of card (alt+t)

Tokens

R+ = Add Resource 
R- = Subtract Resource

W+ = Add Wound 
W- = Subtract Wound

T+ = Add Travel Token
T- = Subtract Travel Token

O+ = Add Orange Token
O- = Subtract Orange Token

R+ = Add Red Token
R- = Subtarct Red Token

I+ = Add Indego Token
I- = Subtract Indego Token

Now there is so much room I could add buttons for the other three general tokens. I 

havn't yet as I want to get feedback fomr the iPad users as I do not have a iPad so I 

can not tell how much space has been freed up. For anow you can acress the tokens via 

the keyboard shortcuts or right clicking on the card. 

Canned Button (lower bar)

T+ = Add Threat
T- = Subtract Threat
R = Refersh All / Threat +1 / Draw 1 Card (I know this is doubled up, forget about 

that!)
S1 = Save 1
L1 = Load 1
D6 = Draw 6
M = Mulligan
C = Choose Start Player
P5 = Peak 5 (Look at top 5 of your own deck)
P3 = Peak 3
P1 = Peak 1
S1 = Scry 1 (Look at top card of Encounter Deck 1)
S2 = Scry 2
S3 = Scry 3
S2 = Save 2
L2 = Load 2
S3 = Save 3
L3 = Load 3
S4 = Save 4
L4 = Load 4
